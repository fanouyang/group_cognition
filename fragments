1	A3	/	Another critical question for us to think is why we need to do the design… We can get connected with vehicles managers 
or users to know more about their using experiences, then make some modification on the function or design.	[Cognitive; ID]
2	A2	A3	We can focus our design on the driving experience or the human-computer interaction in the car, which is closer to 
our experience since we don’t have the engineering expertise.	[Social; Cognitive GM]
3	A3	A2	What do you mean by the human-computer interaction?	[Social; Cognitive GS]
4	A2	A3	I mean… new energy vehicles have the intelligent control function, involving the human-computer interaction.	[Social;
Cognitive IM]
5	A1	A2	Do you mean the driverless cars?	[Social; Cognitive GS]
6	A3	A1	No, I mean the common new energy vehicles…	[Social; Cognitivec IM]
7	A2	A3	I think it is okay to focus on the new energy vehicles. We can use the VR techniques in the activity design. 
Since students are supposed to learn relevant theories, we can teach them about the difference of power transmission between 
the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles…	[Social;Cognitive GM]
8	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping (adding content about "new energy vehicle" but later deleting it)	[Behavioral]
9	A1	A2	I think we’d better narrow down the topic you mentioned and make it more targeted.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
10	A3	A1	OK, what is in your mind? Which topic do you suggest to narrow down to?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
11	A3	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
12	A1	A3	I agree with [A2]’s suggestions…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
13	A2	/	…regarding their differences, for instance, the tradition vehicles use engine as transmission, but the new energy 
vehicles may use motor.	[Cognitive ID]
14	A1&A3	/	Observation	(observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
15	A2	/	Regarding this topic, we can focus on engineering design, which means how to make a better design to improve the 
efficiency of energy use… Taking this as the theme of our class, students are supposed to tell the differences of the 
manufacturing techniques between the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles… The transmission is a critical part 
of the technique; students can use VR or online experiments to experience the transmission techniques.	[Cognitive: GD]
16	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping (trying to add more content about vehicle types and later deleting the content)	[Behavioral]
17	A3	A2	Yes, I think your idea is very good. And we can specify it, for example, the different energy types.	[Social;
Cognitive GS]
18	A2	A3	The hybrid-energy vehicle is different from the electrical vehicle, because the hybrid type involves both the 
traditional and the new energy… we can focus on the differences among those three types: electrical, gasoline, and hybrid. 
Then, students can use the VR experiments to dissemble the vehicles and learn and the differences of those three types of 
vehicles. 	[Social;Cognitive GM]
19	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping (adding three vehicle types in the concept map)	[Behavioral]
20	A3	A2	Yes. Students can form groups to focus on different types of vehicles, such as [many different types of energy] .... 
We can let students learn the theories first, and then use the VR to simulate the operations in the virtual laboratory. What do you think?	[Social;
Cognitive GM]
21	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping (continuing to add vehicle types)	[Behavioral]
22	A2	A3	It’s OK. But I think there is no need to differentiate them in such a detailed way...	[Social;Cognitive GM]
23	A3	A2	So we mention them in a generalized way?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
24	A2	A3	Since the focus is the transmission system of the vehicles, not the vehicle itself, so I think the vehicles 
can be simply divided into three types.   	[Social;Cognitive GM]
25	A3	A2	Which three types?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
26	A2	A3	The electrical, the hybrid, and the traditional vehicles.	[Social;Cognitive IM]
27	A1	/	Concept mapping	(continuing to modify vehicle types) [Behavioral]
28	A3	A2	OK, so students are supposed to conduct the virtual experiments on those three types.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
29	A1	/	Concept mapping	(continuing to modify vehicle types) [Behavioral]

1	B1	/	Do we need to assign a role to students in the group? I think it would be inappropriate for all students to do the 
same thing… do we ask the students to form a group by themselves? Or form a group randomly?	[Cognitive ID]
2	B3	/	Concept mapping	(adding "experimental groups" in the concept map) [Behavioral]
3	B3	B1	Random grouping？Why?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
4	B1	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
5	B1	B3	…someone in the group would take responsible for the marketing, then he or she needs to do some research… someone 
might be good at manufacturing, like an engineer. If there is a role assignment, it can help them to use their strengths 
better.  	[Social;Cognitive ID]
6	B3	/	Concept mapping (adding "marketing" in the concept map)	[Behavioral]
7	B2	B1	Yes, I totally agree. I think we can let the instructor to assign the groups, if she knows students and their 
strengths. but I am afraid if we use random grouping, some groups may not be functioning if students are all not skillful 
at doing this work… Grouping is also an important instructional strategy...	[Social;Cognitive GM]
8	B1	B3	Concept mapping (adding "instructional grouping" in the concept map)	[Social;Behavioral]
9	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
10	B3	B2	Regarding to the grouping, I have an idea. In fact, what we are talking about is to achieve a better grouping 
efficiency… the heterogeneous grouping is a good strategy. There are many different ways to achieve this… you can make the 
groups manually, or you can use an algorithm. 	[Social;Cognitive GD]
11	B1	B3	Concept mapping	(changing to "heterogeneous grouping" in the concept map) [Social;Behavioral]
12	B3	/	The platform may have this kind of grouping function…	[Cognitive GS]
13	B1	B3	Concept mapping	(continuing modifying "heterogeneous grouping" ) [Social;Behavioral]
14	B1	B3	Taking advantage of the platform to achieve this, right?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
15	B3	B1	Yes, we need to solve the problems about using what kind of technical supports.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
16	B3	/	Task understanding (reading tasks)	[Behavioral]
17	B3	/	The platform can provide intelligent grouping function.	[Cognitive GM]
18	B2&B3	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Social;Behavioral]
19	B3	/	Then our practical activity is like to forming a group-based work to achieve the engine assembling practice.	
[Cognitive GM]
20	B3	/	Concept mapping	(modifying "engine assembling practice" in the concept map) [Behavioral]
21	B2	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
22	B3	/	For the engine assembling, what does the platform need to provide? For instance, the platform provides some 
accessories from different brands… students are supposed to figure out how to assemble them. Any idea?	[Cognitive GM]
23	B3	/	Concept mapping (modifying "engine assembling" in the concept map)	[Behavioral]
24	B2	/	Observation	(observing concept map) [Behavioral]
25	B2	B3	We assume that the platform can provide options for students to choose… For example, the groups of students are 
required to complete their design of engine within the limited budget. Then, the instructor can evaluate students’ performance
under such a restricted condition.	[Social;Cognitive ID]
26	B2	/	Observation	(observing concept map) [Behavioral]
27	B1	/	Concept mapping	(modifying platforms in the concept map) [Behavioral]
28	B3	B2	It’s a good idea. It is better to define the requirement specifically, such as who is your target customer. In 
addition, I think we can specify some dimensions to evaluate the groups’ performance of engine assembling. 	[Social;Cognitive ID]
29	B2	/	Observation	(observing concept map)[Behavioral]
30	B2	B3	this part - assigning groups with budget - should be specify.	[Social;Cognitive GM]
31	B2	B3	Concept mapping (adding "budget" in the concept map)	[Social;Behavioral]
32	B1	B2	It means that students form groups, and then the groups randomly receive their tasks.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
33	B3	/	Concept mapping	(modifying student tasks in the concept map) [Behavioral]
34	B2	/	Yes, the task card will tell the student group how much money they can spend to assemble an engine.	[Cognitive GM]
35	B1	B2	I think we could define the target group, for example, if they are rich, they may want to use the more luxurious 
accessories.	[Social;Cognitive GM]
36	B3	/	Concept mapping	(modifying the evaluation of engine in the concept map) [Behavioral]
37	B2	B1	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
38	B3	B1	Forming a group, and then receiving the task.	[Social; Cognitive GM]
39	B3	/	Concept mapping	(modifying the tasks in the concept map) [Behavioral]
40	B2	B3	It is like a mission card. When you open that card, you will find that you are in a specific group with an 
assigned role. And then you will find the amount of money for the group to use. The purpose is to assemble an engine. 
Then the group will log in the online platform to assemble the engine… there will be a mall in the platform…students are 
supposed to learn how to build an engine there.	[Social;Cognitive: GD]
41	B3	/	Concept mapping	 (adding "task cards" in the concept map)[Behavioral]
42	B2	/	Is it necessary to describe details of the types of engine?	[Cognitive GS]
43	B3	B2	It is necessary to clarify the main goals in the card, such as the budget, the target customer, restricted 
conditions, and assemble the engine. For example, the task card one is… two is… how do you guys feel?	[Social;Cognitive GM]
44	B1	B3	I think it’s very interesting.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
45	B1	/	Observation	(observing concept map)[Behavioral]
46	B2	B3	This activity is quite interesting.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
47	B1	B2	Yes, I agree.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
48	B3	/	We give students different situations in the card.	[Cognitive GM]
49	B1	B3	I think it is necessary. If there is no restriction, it will be difficult for the instructor to evaluate students.	[Social;
Cognitive GM]
50	B2	/	I have a question. This design is more focused on the car, not the engine. To evaluate an engine, we need to focus 
on the price/performance ratio…	[Cognitive GM]
51	B1	/	Task understanding	(reading the task) [Behavioral]
52	B2	/	Therefore, we need to specify the budget, situation, price/performance ratio etc.	[Cognitive GM]
53	B2	/	Concept mapping	(moving the concept map) [Behavioral]

1	C3	/	Another approach is the remote lab. A student can operate to control a real entity by using a remote computer… but I 
don’t think schools have this kind of technology…	[Cognitive ID]
2	C1&C2	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
3	C2	C3	We can add it to the practical activity… 	[Social;Cognitive GS]
4	C1&C2&C3	/	Observation (observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
5	C3	C2	Yes, it is the operation part…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
6	C3	/	Organization	(organizaing the concept map) [Behavioral]
7	C2	C3	Is it a part of the virtual experiment?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
8	C3	C2	Yes, it belongs to the virtual experiment…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
9	C2	C3	Okay…so those are virtual and online activities, and here we add a real operation… that is a good idea	[Social;
Cognitive GS]
10	C1	/	Observation (observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
11	C3	C2	Adding the remote lab to virtual experiment, right? Let me think about …	[Social;Cognitive IM]
12	C1	/	Is there a tool that allows all students to share the screen at the same time?	[Cognitive GS]
13	C2	C1	The video conferencing software should be ok…	[Social;Cognitive GM]
14	C3	C2	DingTalk app can only allow us to share one screen, right?	[Social;Cognitive GM]
15	C2	C3	I think so…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
16	C3	C1	Let me see, how can all the students share the screen?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
17	C2	C3	Something like a big monitoring screen, right?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
18	C1	/	The instructor can engage in to guide the students’ practical activities…	[Cognitive IM]
19	C2	C1	Make sense!	[Social;Cognitive GS]
20	C3	C1	Okay… This is like a video conference… the student turns on the webcam, then the instructor can see what the 
student is doing during the practical activity… is this what you mean?	[Social;Cognitive GM]
21	C1	/	Observation(observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
22	C2	C3	There is no need to have all the students share the screen… the instructor can request one student to share the 
screen if needed… the student can also request if he needs help…	[Social;Cognitive GM]
23	C3	C1	I think what C1 means is… during the in-class activity, the instructor wants to know students’ practice process…
even if the student did not ask the instructor a question	[Social;Cognitive:GD]
24	C1	C3	Yep, that is what I mean…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
25	C2	C1	All right, I got it. What strategy can support it?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
26	C1	/	Observation (observing the concept map)	[Behavioral]
27	C3	C2	Video conferencing is a simple way to teach online… Video conferencing is also used frequently in practice… 
students may not want to buy more advanced equipment…	[Social;Cognitive:GD]
28	C2	C3	What you just mentioned that the instructor can monitor all students’ learning… it is in school’s computer labs…	
[Social;Cognitive GM]
29	C1	/	Observation (observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
30	C1	C2	Yep…	[Social;Cognitive GS]
31	C3	C2	So the situation is, every student needs to turn on the webcam… which may be difficult in real situations because 
the student can decide to turn it on or not… but this could be a strategy…	[Social;Cognitive:GD]
32	C3	/	Let me see, where can I put the theory lecture part? …activities, theory, or practice?	[Cognitive GS]
33	C3&C1		Observation	(observing the concept map)[Behavioral]
34	C3	/	How about put the practice at the beginning?... it is an in-class activity…	[Cognitive IM]
35	C3	/	Concept mapping (adding in-class practice in the concept map)	[Behavioral]
36	C2	C3	These can all be put in the in-class activities actually… we can further describe them.	[Social;Cognitive IM]
37	C3	C2	Those are difficult for students… let me think about it…	[Social;Cognitive GM]
38	C1	/	Observation	(observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
39	C3	/	Actually, it is a kind of guidance via video conferencing.	[Cognitive IM]
40	C3	/	Concept mapping	(adding "video conferencing instruction" in the concept map)[Behavioral]
41	C2	/	Observation	(observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
42	C2	C3	Is this practical activity an instructional strategy?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
43	C3	C2	Which one are you talking about?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
44	C2	C3	I mean the guidance of the video conferencing.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
45	C3	C2	Yes, I was thinking that we forgot to list it as a separate part…let me think… Those parts like data simulation, 
virtual experiment and modelling are some concrete ways of practical activities…	[Social;Cognitive ID]
46	C3	/	Organization & Observation	(moving the whole concept map and observing) [Behavioral]
47	C2	C2	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
48	C3	C2	Those are the strategies, right?	[Social;Cognitive GS]
49	C3	/	Concept mapping	(adding simulation strategy in the concept map) [Behavioral]
50	C3	/	I think the practical activity should be listed separately… it is parallel to the strategy	[Cognitive GM]
51	C2	C3	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
52	C3	/	Then you can introduce data simulation, virtual experiment and modelling… I mean these are introduction of practical
activities… the previous part is the instructional strategy.	[Cognitive GM]
53	C2	/	Observation	(observing the concept map) [Behavioral]
54	C2	C3	Yep, instructional strategy… so we need to combine it to this part.	[Social;Cognitive GS]
55	C3	/	Concept mapping	(adding virtual experiment in the concept map) [Behavioral]
