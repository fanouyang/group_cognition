1	A3	/	Another critical question for us to think is why we need to do the design… We can get connected with vehicles managers 
or users to know more about their using experiences, then make some modification on the function or design.	[Cognitive]
2	A2	A3	We can focus our design on the driving experience or the human-computer interaction in the car, which is closer to 
our experience since we don’t have the engineering expertise.	[Social; Cognitive]
3	A3	A2	What do you mean by the human-computer interaction?	[Social; Cognitive]
4	A2	A3	I mean… new energy vehicles have the intelligent control function, involving the human-computer interaction.	[Social;
Cognitive]
5	A1	A2	Do you mean the driverless cars?	[Social; Cognitive]
6	A3	A1	No, I mean the common new energy vehicles…	[Social; Cognitive]
7	A2	A3	I think it is okay to focus on the new energy vehicles. We can use the VR techniques in the activity design. 
Since students are supposed to learn relevant theories, we can teach them about the difference of power transmission between 
the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles…	[Social;Cognitive]
8	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	Behavioral
9	A1	A2	I think we’d better narrow down the topic you mentioned and make it more targeted.	[Social;Cognitive]
10	A3	A1	OK, what is in your mind? Which topic do you suggest to narrow down to?	[Social;Cognitive]
11	A3	/	Observation	Behavioral
12	A1	A3	I agree with [A2]’s suggestions…	[Social;Cognitive]
13	A2	/	…regarding their differences, for instance, the tradition vehicles use engine as transmission, but the new energy 
vehicles may use motor.	[Cognitive]
14	A1&A3	/	Observation	Behavioral
15	A2	/	Regarding this topic, we can focus on engineering design, which means how to make a better design to improve the 
efficiency of energy use… Taking this as the theme of our class, students are supposed to tell the differences of the 
manufacturing techniques between the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles… The transmission is a critical part 
of the technique; students can use VR or online experiments to experience the transmission techniques.	[Cognitive]
16	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	Behavioral
17	A3	A2	Yes, I think your idea is very good. And we can specify it, for example, the different energy types.	[Social;
Cognitive]
18	A2	A3	The hybrid-energy vehicle is different from the electrical vehicle, because the hybrid type involves both the 
traditional and the new energy… we can focus on the differences among those three types: electrical, gasoline, and hybrid. 
Then, students can use the VR experiments to dissemble the vehicles and learn and the differences of those three types of 
vehicles. 	[Social;Cognitive]
19	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	Behavioral
20	A3	A2	Yes. Students can form groups to focus on different types of vehicles, such as [many different types of energy] .... We can let students learn the theories first, and then use the VR to simulate the operations in the virtual laboratory. What do you think?	Social;
[Cognitive]
21	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	Behavioral
22	A2	A3	It’s OK. But I think there is no need to differentiate them in such a detailed way...	[Social;Cognitive]
23	A3	A2	So we mention them in a generalized way?	Social;
Cognitive
24	A2	A3	Since the focus is the transmission system of the vehicles, not the vehicle itself, so I think the vehicles 
can be simply divided into three types.   	[Social;Cognitive]
25	A3	A2	Which three types?	[Social;Cognitive]
26	A2	A3	The electrical, the hybrid, and the traditional vehicles.	[Social;Cognitive]
27	A1	/	Concept mapping	Behavioral
28	A3	A2	OK, so students are supposed to conduct the virtual experiments on those three types.	[Social;Cognitive]
