1	A3	/	Another critical question for us to think is why we need to do the design… We can get connected with vehicles managers 
or users to know more about their using experiences, then make some modification on the function or design.	[Cognitive]
2	A2	A3	We can focus our design on the driving experience or the human-computer interaction in the car, which is closer to 
our experience since we don’t have the engineering expertise.	[Social; Cognitive]
3	A3	A2	What do you mean by the human-computer interaction?	[Social; Cognitive]
4	A2	A3	I mean… new energy vehicles have the intelligent control function, involving the human-computer interaction.	[Social;
Cognitive]
5	A1	A2	Do you mean the driverless cars?	[Social; Cognitive]
6	A3	A1	No, I mean the common new energy vehicles…	[Social; Cognitive]
7	A2	A3	I think it is okay to focus on the new energy vehicles. We can use the VR techniques in the activity design. 
Since students are supposed to learn relevant theories, we can teach them about the difference of power transmission between 
the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles…	[Social;Cognitive]
8	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping (adding content about new energy vehicle)	[Behavioral]
9	A1	A2	I think we’d better narrow down the topic you mentioned and make it more targeted.	[Social;Cognitive]
10	A3	A1	OK, what is in your mind? Which topic do you suggest to narrow down to?	[Social;Cognitive]
11	A3	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
12	A1	A3	I agree with [A2]’s suggestions…	[Social;Cognitive]
13	A2	/	…regarding their differences, for instance, the tradition vehicles use engine as transmission, but the new energy 
vehicles may use motor.	[Cognitive]
14	A1&A3	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
15	A2	/	Regarding this topic, we can focus on engineering design, which means how to make a better design to improve the 
efficiency of energy use… Taking this as the theme of our class, students are supposed to tell the differences of the 
manufacturing techniques between the tradition vehicles and the new energy vehicles… The transmission is a critical part 
of the technique; students can use VR or online experiments to experience the transmission techniques.	[Cognitive]
16	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
17	A3	A2	Yes, I think your idea is very good. And we can specify it, for example, the different energy types.	[Social;
Cognitive]
18	A2	A3	The hybrid-energy vehicle is different from the electrical vehicle, because the hybrid type involves both the 
traditional and the new energy… we can focus on the differences among those three types: electrical, gasoline, and hybrid. 
Then, students can use the VR experiments to dissemble the vehicles and learn and the differences of those three types of 
vehicles. 	[Social;Cognitive]
19	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
20	A3	A2	Yes. Students can form groups to focus on different types of vehicles, such as [many different types of energy] .... We can let students learn the theories first, and then use the VR to simulate the operations in the virtual laboratory. What do you think?	Social;
[Cognitive]
21	A1	/	Observation & Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
22	A2	A3	It’s OK. But I think there is no need to differentiate them in such a detailed way...	[Social;Cognitive]
23	A3	A2	So we mention them in a generalized way?	[Social;Cognitive]
24	A2	A3	Since the focus is the transmission system of the vehicles, not the vehicle itself, so I think the vehicles 
can be simply divided into three types.   	[Social;Cognitive]
25	A3	A2	Which three types?	[Social;Cognitive]
26	A2	A3	The electrical, the hybrid, and the traditional vehicles.	[Social;Cognitive]
27	A1	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
28	A3	A2	OK, so students are supposed to conduct the virtual experiments on those three types.	[Social;Cognitive]

Line	From	To	Content	Dimension
1	B1	/	Do we need to assign a role to students in the group? I think it would be inappropriate for all students to do the 
same thing… do we ask the students to form a group by themselves? Or form a group randomly?	[Cognitive]
2	B3	/	Concept mapping	Behavioral
3	B3	B1	Random grouping？Why?	[Social;Cognitive]
4	B1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
5	B1	B3	…someone in the group would take responsible for the marketing, then he or she needs to do some research… someone 
might be good at manufacturing, like an engineer. If there is a role assignment, it can help them to use their strengths 
better.  	[Social;Cognitive]
6	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
7	B2	B1	Yes, I totally agree. I think we can let the instructor to assign the groups, if she knows students and their 
strengths. but I am afraid if we use random grouping, some groups may not be functioning if students are all not skillful 
at doing this work… Grouping is also an important instructional strategy...	[Social;Cognitive]
8	B1	B3	Concept mapping	[Social;Behavioral]
9	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
10	B3	B2	Regarding to the grouping, I have an idea. In fact, what we are talking about is to achieve a better grouping 
efficiency… the heterogeneous grouping is a good strategy. There are many different ways to achieve this… you can make the 
groups manually, or you can use an algorithm. 	[Social;Cognitive]
11	B1	B3	Concept mapping	Social
Behavioral
12	B3	/	The platform may have this kind of grouping function…	[Cognitive]
13	B1	B3	Concept mapping	[Social;Behavioral]
14	B1	B3	Taking advantage of the platform to achieve this, right?	[Social;Cognitive]
15	B3	B1	Yes, we need to solve the problems about using what kind of technical supports.	[Social;Cognitive]
16	B3	/	Task understanding 	[Behavioral]
17	B3	/	The platform can provide intelligent grouping function.	[Cognitive]
18	B2&B3	/	Observation 	[Social;Behavioral]
19	B3	/	Then our practical activity is like to forming a group-based work to achieve the engine assembling practice.	
[Cognitive]
20	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
21	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
22	B3	/	For the engine assembling, what does the platform need to provide? For instance, the platform provides some 
accessories from different brands… students are supposed to figure out how to assemble them. Any idea?	[Cognitive]
23	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
24	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
25	B2	B3	We assume that the platform can provide options for students to choose… For example, the groups of students are 
required to complete their design of engine within the limited budget. Then, the instructor can evaluate students’ performance
under such a restricted condition.	[Social;Cognitive]
26	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
27	B1	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
28	B3	B2	It’s a good idea. It is better to define the requirement specifically, such as who is your target customer. In 
addition, I think we can specify some dimensions to evaluate the groups’ performance of engine assembling. 	[Social;Cognitive]
29	B2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
30	B2	B3	this part - assigning groups with budget - should be specify.	[Social;Cognitive]
31	B2	B3	Concept mapping	[Social;Behavioral]
32	B1	B2	It means that students form groups, and then the groups randomly receive their tasks.	[Social;Cognitive]
33	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
34	B2	/	Yes, the task card will tell the student group how much money they can spend to assemble an engine.	[Cognitive]
35	B1	B2	I think we could define the target group, for example, if they are rich, they may want to use the more luxurious 
accessories.	[Social;Cognitive]
36	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
37	B2	B1	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive]
38	B3	B1	Forming a group, and then receiving the task.	[Social;Behavioral]
39	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
40	B2	B3	It is like a mission card. When you open that card, you will find that you are in a specific group with an 
assigned role. And then you will find the amount of money for the group to use. The purpose is to assemble an engine. 
Then the group will log in the online platform to assemble the engine… there will be a mall in the platform…students are 
supposed to learn how to build an engine there.	[Social;Cognitive]
41	B3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
42	B2	/	Is it necessary to describe details of the types of engine?	[Cognitive]
43	B3	B2	It is necessary to clarify the main goals in the card, such as the budget, the target customer, restricted 
conditions, and assemble the engine. For example, the task card one is… two is… how do you guys feel?	[Social;Cognitive]
44	B1	B3	I think it’s very interesting.	[Social;Cognitive]
45	B1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
46	B2	B3	This activity is quite interesting.	[Social;Cognitive]
47	B1	B2	Yes, I agree.	[Social;Cognitive]
48	B3	/	We give students different situations in the card.	[Cognitive]
49	B1	B3	I think it is necessary. If there is no restriction, it will be difficult for the instructor to evaluate students.	Social
[Cognitive]
50	B2	/	I have a question. This design is more focused on the car, not the engine. To evaluate an engine, we need to focus 
on the price/performance ratio…	[Cognitive]
51	B1	/	Task understanding	[Behavioral]
52	B2	/	Therefore, we need to specify the budget, situation, price/performance ratio etc.	[Cognitive]
53	B2	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]

1	C3	/	Another approach is the remote lab. A student can operate to control a real entity by using a remote computer… but I 
don’t think schools have this kind of technology…	[Cognitive]
2	C1&C2	/	Observation 	[Behavioral]
3	C2	C3	We can add it to the practical activity… 	[Social;Cognitive]
4	C1&C2&C3	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
5	C3	C2	Yes, it is the operation part…	[Social;Cognitive]
6	C3	/	Organization	[Behavioral]
7	C2	C3	Is it a part of the virtual experiment?	[Social;Cognitive]
8	C3	C2	Yes, it belongs to the virtual experiment…	[Social;Cognitive]
9	C2	C3	Okay…so those are virtual and online activities, and here we add a real operation… that is a good idea	[Social;
Cognitive]
10	C1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
11	C3	C2	Adding the remote lab to virtual experiment, right? Let me think about …	[Social;Cognitive]
12	C1	/	Is there a tool that allows all students to share the screen at the same time?	[Cognitive]
13	C2	C1	The video conferencing software should be ok…	[Social;Cognitive]
14	C3	C2	DingTalk app can only allow us to share one screen, right?	[Social;Cognitive]
15	C2	C3	I think so…	[Social;Cognitive]
16	C3	C1	Let me see, how can all the students share the screen?	[Social;Cognitive]
17	C2	C3	Something like a big monitoring screen, right?	[Social;Cognitive]
18	C1	/	The instructor can engage in to guide the students’ practical activities…	[Cognitive]
19	C2	C1	Make sense!	[Social;Cognitive]
20	C3	C1	Okay… This is like a video conference… the student turns on the webcam, then the instructor can see what the 
student is doing during the practical activity… is this what you mean?	[Social;Cognitive]
21	C1	/	Observation	Behavioral
22	C2	C3	There is no need to have all the students share the screen… the instructor can request one student to share the 
screen if needed… the student can also request if he needs help…	[Social;Cognitive]
23	C3	C1	I think what A1 means is… during the in-class activity, the instructor wants to know students’ practice process…
even if the student did not ask the instructor a question	[Social;Cognitive]
24	C1	C3	Yep, that is what I mean…	[Social;Cognitive]
25	C2	C1	All right, I got it. What strategy can support it?	[Social;Cognitive]
26	C1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
27	C3	C2	Video conferencing is a simple way to teach online… Video conferencing is also used frequently in practice… 
students may not want to buy more advanced equipment…	[Social;Cognitive]
28	C2	C3	What you just mentioned that the instructor can monitor all students’ learning… it is in school’s computer labs…	
[Social;Cognitive]
29	C1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
30	C1	C2	Yep…	[Social;Cognitive]
31	C3	C2	So the situation is, every student needs to turn on the webcam… which may be difficult in real situations because 
the student can decide to turn it on or not… but this could be a strategy…	[Social;Cognitive]
32	C3	/	Let me see, where can I put the theory lecture part? …activities, theory, or practice?	[Cognitive]
33	C3&C1		Observation	[Behavioral]
34	C3	/	How about put the practice at the beginning?... it is an in-class activity…	[Cognitive]
35	C3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
36	C2	C3	These can all be put in the in-class activities actually… we can further describe them.	[Social;Cognitive]
37	C3	C2	Those are difficult for students… let me think about it…	[Social;Cognitive]
38	C1	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
39	C3	/	Actually, it is a kind of guidance via video conferencing.	[Cognitive]
40	C3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
41	C2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
42	C2	C3	Is this practical activity an instructional strategy?	[Social;Cognitive]
43	C3	C2	Which one are you talking about?	[Social;Cognitive]
44	C2	C3	I mean the guidance of the video conferencing.	[Social;Cognitive]
45	C3	C2	Yes, I was thinking that we forgot to list it as a separate part…let me think… Those parts like data simulation, 
virtual experiment and modelling are some concrete ways of practical activities…	[Social;Cognitive]
46	C3	/	Organization & Observation	[Behavioral]
47	C2	C2	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive]
48	C3	C2	Those are the strategies, right?	[Social;Cognitive]
49	C3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
50	C3	/	I think the practical activity should be listed separately… it is parallel to the strategy	[Cognitive]
51	C2	C3	Yep.	[Social;Cognitive]
52	C3	/	Then you can introduce data simulation, virtual experiment and modelling… I mean these are introduction of practical
activities… the previous part is the instructional strategy.	[Cognitive]
53	C2	/	Observation	[Behavioral]
54	C2	C3	Yep, instructional strategy… so we need to combine it to this part.	[Social;Cognitive]
55	C3	/	Concept mapping	[Behavioral]
